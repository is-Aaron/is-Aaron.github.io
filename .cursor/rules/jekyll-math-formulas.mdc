# Math Formula Rules

Site uses kramdown (server-side) + MathJax v3 (client-side). kramdown runs first, may corrupt LaTeX.

- **Inline math**: Use `$...$`. NEVER use `\(...\)` — kramdown treats `\(` as escaped parenthesis, strips the backslash.
- **Display math**: `$$` must be on its own line, blank lines before and after.
- **Absolute values/norms**: Use `\lvert`/`\rvert` inside `$$` blocks. Bare `|` at line start may be parsed as table.
- **Front matter**: `math: true` is required to load MathJax.
